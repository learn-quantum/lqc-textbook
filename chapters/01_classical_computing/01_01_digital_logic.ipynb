    "All modern computers and communication systems rely on the use of binary numbers. The fundamental unit of a binary number is the **bit**, which can take only two values: $0$ or $1$, but just like with decimal numbers, we can express larger binary values by concatenating bits together. For example, with 3 bits, we can express up to 8 different binary numbers:\n",

    "| 110 | 6 |\n",
    "| 111 | 7 |\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $n$ bits allow us to express up to $2^n$ different values. So, an $n$-bit binary number $b$ can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b = b_{n-1} ... b_1 b_0 ,$$\n",

    "where each bit $b_i$ can take the value $0$ or $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notation, the bit most to the left, $b_0$, is known as the least significant bit (LSB). The bit most to the right, $b_{n-1}$, is known as the most significant bit (MSB).\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a binary number $b$ to a decimal integer $x$, we simply take each of the individual bits, and multiply them by 2 exponentiated to the bit's significance, and then sum them up:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x =  2^{n-1} b_{n-1} + ... + 2^{1} b_{1} + 2^{0} b_{0}, $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ x = \\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} 2^{i} b_i .$$\n",

    "## 3. Digital Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital circuits are a diagrammatic representation of Boolean logic operations that directly maps to a physical implementation using electronic hardware. Understanding circuits is of great interest to us because different computational problems can be mapped onto this model, facilitating their classification into different complexity classes by using [circuit complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_complexity). As we will see in later chapters, this approach is widely used to analyze the type of advantage quantum algorithms can offer over a classical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical circuits are constructed by interconnecting fundamental [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra#Digital_logic_gates) associated with the three basic Boolean operations: **NOT**, **OR**, **AND**. The figure below shows the gate symbols for these three operators (from left to right):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\01_01_01_basic_logic_gates.png\" align = \"center\" width=\"750\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the **XOR** operator is so widely used that it has its own symbol, even though it can be constructed out of **NOT**, **OR** and **AND** gates:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\01_01_02_xor.png\" align = \"center\" width=\"180\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another schematic simplification is to use a circle at the inputs or output of the binary gates to \"absorb\" a negation. For example, a **AND** / **OR** / **XOR** gate immediately followed by a **NOT** gate can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\01_01_03_negated_logic_gates.png\" align = \"center\" width=\"790\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "These three gates are common enough that receive the names **NAND** / **NOR** / **XNOR**.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using only these fundamental gates, we can then compose digital circuits for more complicated Boolean operations. For example, let's say we want to construct a circuit that takes two bits $a$, $b$, and an input carry $c_{in}$, and adds them into an output $s$, and an output carry $c_{out}$. We can express this in the form of a truth table:\n",

    "| $a$ | $b$ | $c_{in}$ | $s$ | $c_{out}$ |\n",

    "It is not difficult to show that $s = a \\oplus b \\oplus c_{in}$, which is expected since the **XOR** operation is equivalent to  addition modulo 2. Finding the expression for $c_{out}$ is slightly more involved since it requires synthesizing a Boolean expression by using methods like the [sum of products conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form#Conversion_to_DNF) or [Karnaugh maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnaugh_map), which we will not cover here. It suffices to say that it can be shown that $c_{out} = ((a \\oplus b) \\land c_{in}) \\lor (a \\land b) $, which results in the circuit shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "A concept that we have not yet discussed but is commonly utilized in circuit complexity analysis is that of the **COPY** or **FAN-OUT** operation. In the circuit above, we see that, for example, the variable $a$ is used as an input on two separate gates. This variable was copied (or fanned-out) when a single wire turned into two separate ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\01_01_05_fanout.png\" align = \"center\" width=\"80\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "From a schematic standpoint, this might seem trivial considering that this will only require connecting an additional wire. However, from the point of complexity analysis this is an important operation because, as we will see later, there is no equivalent to the **COPY** operation in quantum circuits.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight of being able to implement more complex Boolean circuits out of fundamental logic gates is that we can follow this process to construct all the building blocks of modern classical computing systems. Using only these gates, we can not only develop all the [combinatorial logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic) used to build, for example, the core [arithmetic logic unit (ALU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit) in a [central processing unit (CPU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit), but also all [sequential logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_logic) (latches, flip-flops, registers) required to store and parse its data.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it is worth mentioning that, at a physical level, digital logic gates are not fundamental but are rather implemented using transistors. At this point, we will not go into any details on how these devices work, but hopefully in the future this section will be expanded to include some of the basics. This is important if we want to understand how quantum processors differ from classical devices at the hardware level.\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we will continue to build our understanding towards quantum computing. An important step in this process is to introduce a different model of computation known as [reversible computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing). This is an important step in this process because the physical implementation of quantum hardware relies on quantum mechanics, which in principle is a reversible theory and therefore its model of computation should be reversible too."
