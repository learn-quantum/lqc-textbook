    "In the previous section, we constructed a reversible **OR** gate by using other gates: two $\\text{X}$ gates and a $\\text{CCX}$ gate. We can use this same idea to compose more complex circuits. And, since we have now shown that we have the basic gates we had for non-reversible logic, we should be able to basically implement any circuit we want.\n",

    "For example, we could construct a one-to-one replacement of the full adder we showed in the previous chapter:\n",

    "<img src=\"images\\01_02_09_reversible_adder.png\" align = \"center\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note about the reversible version of this circuit is that, it will be fairly common to require several \"auxiliary\" lines to carry out our computation and provide a result. In this particular example, we managed to get the sum output $s$ using only the lines connected to our inputs, but to compute the output carry $c_{out}$ we needed three additional lines initialized to some specific value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, just to verify that the circuit above does indeed act as a full adder, we can use the $\\text{X}$, $\\text{CX}$ and $\\text{CCX}$ Python functions we defined above to implement this circuit. We will only display the relevant outputs $s$ and $c_{out}$, but the code makes all five outputs available in case we wanted to reverse the computation."
