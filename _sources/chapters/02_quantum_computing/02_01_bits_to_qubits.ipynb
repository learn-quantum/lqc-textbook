    "Quantum computers, or more precisely, quantum processing units (QPUs), are devices that exploit quantum-mechanical effects to perform certain computations at a much faster rate than conventional (classical) computers. In order to understand how these devices work, we must familiarize ourselves with the quantum phenomena that enables this added computational advantage. In particular, we must understand the concepts of [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition), [entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) and [quantum interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference).\n",

    "From a computational standpoint, qubits are a generalization of classical bits and are the fundamental unit in quantum computing.

    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental properties of electrons is that they have an intrinsic angular momentum. This property is commonly known as spin, even though particles are not really spinning. The spin of an electron can be deduced experimentally by using what is known as a [Stern-Gerlach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment) apparatus. This device consists of two magnet poles shaped in a way such that the magnetic field between them is **non-uniform**, having a higher intensity at the top where the magnet is sharper: \n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, if an object with a magnetic moment, like a tiny bar magnet, is sent into this device along the $y$ direction, it will experience a force in the vertical $z$ direction that will cause it to deflect upwards or downwards. A bar magnet with its north pole pointing up will deflect upwards. On the other hand, a bar magnet with its north pole pointing down will deflect downwards:\n",

    "<img src=\"images/02_01_02_stern-gerlach_n-s_magnets.png\" align = \"center\" width=\"700\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the force experienced by the bar magnet depends on the angle $\\theta$ between its magnetic moment (i.e., where its north pole points to) and the direction of the external magnetic field. Therefore, if we were to perform this experiment for bar magnets with varying angles in the magnetic moment, the z-axis landing location on the back screen will vary between where the landing position of the up-pointing and down-pointing magnets, and will be dependent on the angle $\\theta$.\n",

So, if we were to replace the magnets with electrons in the experiment above[$^*$](#footnote1), the expectation is that we should see the exact same behavior of electrons being deflected in the $z$ direction as a function of the angle between the electron's magnetic moment and the direction of the external magnetic field.\n",

Since discussions about the measurement problem are outside the scope of this textbook, we will simply use the empirical evidence from these experiments to build a model for how to describe these particles.\n",
    "\n",

However, it is not difficult to see that there is really nothing special about setting up the Stern-Gerlach apparatus with its varying field along the $z$ axis. We can perfectly rotate the device so the field is now in the $x$ direction. And, if we now send electrons with their spin along the $\\texttt{+}x$ (or $\\texttt{-}x$) axis, we will see them deflect to the right (or to the left) accordingly, which shows that there is indeed a way to experimentally tell these are two different states:\n",

    "A key observation from the probabilistic model we proposed above is that, since the components $P_{\\texttt{+}z}$ and $P_{\\texttt{-}z}$ of the vector $\\vec{s}$ are probabilities (which are numbers between $0$ and $1$ and must always add up to $1$), there is simply no way we can recover the original vector that describes $\\vec{s}_{\\texttt{+}z}$ by using linear combinations of other probability vectors. This is because the second entry in $\\vec{s}_{\\texttt{+}z}$ is a $0$, so there are no two positive numbers that can add up to it (unless they are both $0$). What this implies is that, for our maths to work, we need to also allow **negative** entries in our vectors. However, since these vectors still need to describe probabilistic experimental results and probabilities cannot be negative, we need a new rule that tells us how to relate these new vector elements to probabilities. \n",
