    "Quantum computers, or more precisely, quantum processing units (QPUs), are devices that exploit quantum-mechanical effects to speed up certain computational tasks when compared to conventional (classical) computers. In order to understand how these devices work, we must familiarize ourselves with the quantum phenomena that enables this added computational advantage. In particular, we must understand the concepts of [superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition), [entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) and [quantum interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#Quantum_interference).\n",

    "From a computational standpoint, qubits are a generalization of classical bits and are the fundamental unit in quantum computing. There are many different ways in which we can introduce the concept of a qubit. Here, we will follow a relatively intuitive approach by looking at how electrons behave under the influence of an external magnetic field.\n",

    "### 1.1 The Spin of an Electron\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental properties of electrons is that they have an intrinsic angular momentum. This property is commonly known as spin, even though particles are not really spinning. The spin of an electron can be deduced experimentally by using what is known as a [Stern-Gerlach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment) apparatus. This device consists of two magnet poles shaped in a way such that the magnetic field between them is **non-uniform**, having a higher intensity at the top where the magnet is sharper: \n",

    "Therefore, if an object with a magnetic moment, like a tiny bar magnet, is sent into this device along the $y$ direction, it will experience a force in the vertical $z$ direction that will cause it to deflect upwards or downwards. A bar magnet with its north pole pointing up will deflect upwards. On the other hand, a bar magnet with its north pole pointing down will deflect downwards:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the force experienced by the bar magnet depends on the angle $\\theta$ between its magnetic moment (i.e., where its north pole points to) and the direction of the external magnetic field. Therefore, if we were to perform this experiment for bar magnets with varying angles in the magnetic moment, the z-axis landing location on the back screen will vary between where the landing position of the up-pointing and down-pointing magnets, and will be dependent on the angle $\\theta$.\n",

So, if we were to replace the magnets with electrons in the experiment above[$^*$](#footnote1), the expectation is that we should see the exact same behavior of electrons being deflected in the $z$ direction as a function of the angle between the electron's magnetic moment and the direction of the external magnetic field.\n",

    "A key observation from the probabilistic model we proposed above is that, since the components $p_{\\texttt{+}z}$ and $p_{\\texttt{-}z}$ of the vector $\\vec{s}$ are probabilities (which are numbers between $0$ and $1$ and must always add up to $1$), there is simply no way we can recover the original vector that describes $\\vec{s}_{\\texttt{+}z}$ by using linear combinations of other probability vectors. This is because the second entry in $\\vec{s}_{\\texttt{+}z}$ is a $0$, and there are no two positive numbers that can add up to it (unless they are both $0$). What this implies is that, for our maths to work, we need to also allow **negative** entries in our vectors. However, since these vectors still need to describe probabilistic experimental results (and probabilities cannot be negative), we need a new rule that tells us how to relate these new vector elements to probabilities. \n",

    "In a [previous chapter](../01_classical_computing/01_03_bits_to_vectors.ipynb), we discussed how we can represent classical bits and reversible circuits using vectors and matrices. More specifically, we denoted that the values a bit can take ($0$ and $1$) could be \"upgraded\" into the following two vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "|0 \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\quad \\text{ and } \\quad\n",
    "|1 \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it is not hard to see that these are exactly the same vectors we associated with the spin of an electron pointing in the $\\texttt{+}z$ and $\\texttt{-}z$ directions. But of course, we also saw that electrons can point in more than just these two directions. Specifically, we looked into the vector representation of the spin pointing in the $\\texttt{+}x$ and $\\texttt{-}x$ directions, which have no analog in the classical representation of binary systems (or even probability vectors). Instead, the elements of the spin vectors correspond probability amplitudes, which are a uniquely quantum effect. Therefore, we call these new type of vectors **qubits**. So we are going to stick to the idea of spin representing a qubit, but we are going to make a few notational replacements. From now on, we will associate the spin-up of our electron with the vector symbol $|0 \\rangle$ (referred as \"state zero\"), and spin-down with $|1 \\rangle$ (\"state one\"). Similarly, we will express the spin-left and spin-right using two new symbols: $|+ \\rangle$ and $|- \\rangle$, which we call \"state plus\" and state minus\", respectively. And like before, these two vectors correspond to **superposition** states of the states $|0 \\rangle$, and $|1 \\rangle$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "|+ \\rangle &= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0 \\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1 \\rangle \n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "|- \\rangle &= \\begin{bmatrix} \\phantom{-} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0 \\rangle - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1 \\rangle \n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But more generally, we had that, for a classical bit vector representation given by the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ | b \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\end{bmatrix}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "the coefficents $\\beta_j$ had to be either $0$ or $1$, and had to meet the condition that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\beta_0^2 + \\beta_1^2 = 1 .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But now, for a quantum vector (i.e., a qubit) we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ | q \\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} q_0 \\\\ q_1 \\end{bmatrix}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $q_j \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |q_0|^2 + |q_1|^2 = 1 .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, the coeffients of our qubit $| q \\rangle$ are complex values whose norm squared must add up to $1$. At this point, this might seem like a lot to unpack because we have only seen these coefficients take positive and negative values (not complex), but in the next section we will see that there is a logical explanation of why they must be complex, and what this all means.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's keep focusing in the four states we've described so far and use Qiskit to start implementing qubits in Python. To do so, we will use a specific module within Qiskit called `quantum_info`, which has some easy-to-use classes to create and manipulate qubits, which we will refer to as Statevectors."

    "Just like classical digital circuits, quantum circuits are an abstraction of physical operations that modify the state of a set of qubits. And, just like in the classical side, quantum circuits can be distilled into some basic operations represented by what we call **quantum gates**. Now, to understand this a bit better, it is useful to draw a parallel between the physical operations we apply to, let's say, the spin of an electron that represents our qubit, and the diagrammatic abstraction of our circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's describe step by step what is shown in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/02_01_10_spin_vs_qubit_x.png\" align = \"center\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start at time $t_0$ with an electron for which we do not where its spin is pointing to. In the circuit diagram we represent this state with with an arbitrary ket symbol: $|?\\rangle$.\n",
    "- At time $t_1$, the electron goes through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus (labeled SG1). We know that due to the probabilistic nature of the spin of the electron, only spin-up or spin-down electrons will come out of SG1, each with some probability of occurrence. We can then set our experiment to have a screen that only detects spin-down electrons, in which case we will ignore the outcome and repeat the experiment. In the cases were we don't measure anything on the screen, we know we will have a spin-up electron coming out of this setup. In our circuit, we represent this operation with a block known as a post-selection gate (labeled as $|0\\rangle \\langle 0|$). All this gate represents is that, no matter what state goes into it, it only \"spits out\" state $|0\\rangle$.\n",
    "- Therefore, at $t_2$, we have only spin-up electrons in our physical setup, which in our circuit diagram we represent with a qubit in state $|0\\rangle$. This step is commonly known as ground-state or zero-state **preparation**, and it is often assumed that it will take place before executing our algorithms, so we usually don't need to manually specify it in our circuits.\n",
    "- <a name=\"back4\"></a>At time $t_3$, we have our electron go through another apparatus that applies a constant magnetic field to the electron, causing the direction of its spin to rotate. The details of how this works are not important for our current discussion, all we need to know is that, by varying the strength, direction and duration of this field, we can have the spin point in any direction we want[$^§$](#footnote4). In this particular example, we have had the electron spin to flip from spin-up all the way to spin-down. In our circuit, this is represented with an $X$ gate, which should not be a surprise since we [already discussed](../01_classical_computing/01_02_reversible_computing.ipynb#1.1-Reversible-NOT) that this is equivalent to a **NOT** gate for classical reversible circuits.\n",
    "- So, at time $t_4$ we have spin-down electrons, which in our circuit we represent with a qubit in state $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "- Lastly, at $t_5$ we send our electron through another Stern-Gerlach device (SG2) but this time we have a full screen to detect if electrons are being deflected upwards or downwards. In our circuit, this is represented with what is known as a measurement gate, which takes as an input a quantum state, and provides as an output a classical bit corresponding to the state that was probabilistically measured.\n",
    "- So, at time $t_6$, we will only **measure** on the screen electrons hitting the lower part of the screen, since all electrons coming into SG2 were spin-down. And in our circuit, we will see bit $1$ come out as a result every time we execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a quantum circuit will consist of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State preparation**, which almost always corresponds to state $|0\\rangle$.\n",
    "2. **State transformation**, which in the example above corresponded to applying an $X$ gate, but in general this will be a combination of different gates.\n",
    "3. **State measurement**, where our quantum state will be probabilistically projected into classical information (bits) that we can interpret."

Since electrons are charged particles, accelerating them into the apparatus will cause a classical [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force) that will dominate over the effect the magnetic field has on spin. Instead, in the [original experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment#Description), silver atoms where used because they are electrically neutral but still have the same spin behavior as electrons (spin-1/2) due to the presence of an unpaired electron in the outermost orbital.

At this point, the idea is to gain some intuition about what could be happening to the spin of an electron without having to worry to much about how exactly this could be realized.
