    "All modern computers and communication systems rely on the use of binary numbers. The fundamental unit of a binary number is the <span style=\"color:#a883f7\">**bit**</span>, which can only take one of two values: $0$ or $1$. But just like with decimal numbers, we can express larger binary values by concatenating bits together. For example, with 3 bits, we can express up to 8 different binary numbers:\n",

    "To convert a binary number $b$ to a decimal integer $x$, we simply take each of the individual bits, and multiply them by $2$ exponentiated to the bit's significance, and then sum them up:\n",

    "Digital circuits are a diagrammatic representation of Boolean logic operations that can be directly translated into a physical implementation using electronic hardware. Understanding circuits is of great interest to us because different computational problems can be mapped onto this model, facilitating their classification into different complexity classes by using [circuit complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_complexity). As we will see in later chapters, this approach is widely used to analyze the type of advantage quantum algorithms can offer over a classical approach.\n",

For example, let's say we want to construct a circuit that takes two bits $a$, $b$, and an input carry $c_{in}$, and adds them into an output $s$ and an output carry $c_{out}$. We can express this in the form of a truth table:\n",

    "At a physical level, digital logic gates are not fundamental. Instead, they are implemented using transistors. The idea of this section is not to go into the details of how these devices work, but to provide some basic understanding on how they can be used to process Boolean information. This will later help us understand how quantum processors differ from classical devices at the hardware level.\n",

    "Most modern integrated circuits are implemented using what is known as [CMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS) technology, where CMOS stands for complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor.

For the current discussion, all we need to know is that transistors work like switches with two possible states: **ON** or **OFF**. NMOS and PMOS transistors are complementary devices, meaning that the level of voltage that turns one of these devices **ON**, turns the other one **OFF**, and vice versa. This is best exemplified by looking at the circuit used to construct a **NOT** gate:\n",

When the input voltage $v_{in}$ is equal to $+v$ (logical $1$), the NMOS transistor turns **ON** and the PMOS transistor turns **OFF**. This creates a direct connection between the negative power supply at $-v$ (logical $0$) and the output, therefore effectively *negating* the logical value of the input:\n",

    "With these basic blocks, we can then interconnect them together to create any circuit we want. For example, we can implement an **AND** gate by connecting the input of a **NOT** circuit to the output of a **NAND** circuit:\n",

Transistors can then be arranged in circuits where input voltages turn them **ON** and **OFF** (like switches). This in turn modifies the voltage of an output node in a way that the input/output relation corresponds to a logic operation."
