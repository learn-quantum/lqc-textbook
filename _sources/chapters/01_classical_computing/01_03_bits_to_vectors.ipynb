    "An extremely attractive feature of reversible logic is that it maps very naturally to using vectors to represent boolean values (inputs/outputs), and matrices to express operations (gates and circuits). With very little extra work, reversible circuits can be turned into simple linear algebra relations, where multiplying an input vector by a circuit matrix gives us the corresponding output."

    "The first step to transition to a linear algebra representation is to redefine our fundamental unit of information (the bit) as a column vector. We do this by assigning to the two possible values the bit can take ($0$ or $1$) the following representations:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\vec{1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this might look silly. Having a vector with two separate elements to represent a single bit seems rather redundant, but the many reasons for doing this will become evident as we progress throughout the next few chapters. In particular, we will soon see that this vector representation is a very convenient way to express the likelihood of finding a bit to be either $0$ or $1$ when we don't have full knowledge of how our circuits are behaving in the presence of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way to remember this notation is to think of the $1$ inside the vectors as the position of a light switch. Having a $1$ on the top position of the vector can be seen as a switch flipped upwards, which keeps a light bulb OFF (Boolean $0$). Similarly, a $1$ in the bottom of the vector represents the light switch being flipped down, which turns the light bulb ON (Boolean $1$):\n",

    "Now, even though there is nothing stopping us from using arrows on top of $0$ and $1$ to emphasize that they are vectors, this notation is quite unusual. Instead, we will now introduce a new way to express vectors by using what is known as [bra-ket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation) or Dirac notation:\n",

    "Here, the symbol $| \\, \\cdot \\, \\rangle$ is known as a \"ket\". For the time being, a ket is simply a representation for a vector in the same way that placing a hat or arrow on top of a variable is; for example, writing $| b \\rangle$ is equivalent to $\\vec{b}$. Later we will see that kets are typically reserved for specific vectors that belong to a certain type vector space, but the good thing is that the vectors we will work with in this chapter are a subset of this \"family\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We have therefore upgraded our definition of the bit from being a binary number $b \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, to a column vector of the form:\n",

    "where each element $\\beta_j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ must also meet the condition that they can't simultaneously be $0$ or $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly more formal way to formulate this restriction (which will be helpful when we introduce quantum bits) is to say that the magnitude of our vector $| b \\rangle$ should always be equal to $1$: \n",

    "$$ \\|b\\| = 1 .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of vector magnitude we will use (for the moment) is the same we're accustomed to for vectors in geometry. That is, if we have a real-valued vector $\\vec{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\\\ x_1 \\end{bmatrix}$, its magnitude is given by the [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm):\n",

So far, I have stated that in order to recover our original value after applying the $\\text{X}$ gate once we must reapply $\\text{X}$ again. And although this is in fact true, it is not \"formally\" correct. The right thing to do when we want to \"reverse\" the effect of a given gate is to apply the **inverse** of its corresponding matrix.\n",

In general, the Kronecker product is a matrix operation, but we will first introduce it for the simplest case: vectors of dimension 2. If we have two vectors $\\vec{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\\\ x_1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\vec{y} =  \\begin{bmatrix} y_0 \\\\ y_1 \\end{bmatrix}$, their Kronecker product (denoted by the symbol $\\otimes$) is given by:\n",
