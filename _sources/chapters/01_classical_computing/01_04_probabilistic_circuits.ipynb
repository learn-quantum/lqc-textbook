    "The field of probabilistic computing, where the concept of randomness is harnessed to enhance certain computations, is currently experiencing a resurgence driven by the explosion of machine learning and AI algorithms that exploit these effects. However, in the context of classical circuits, randomness is almost always associated with the unwanted effects from noise. Bits stored in magnetic drives can randomly flip when exposed to certain magnetic fields, a **NOT** gate could mistakenly invert its output if there's a glitch in its power supply, and every so often, a cosmic ray particle can cause enough charge accumulation to modify values in memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a natural way to introduce probabilistic effects into digital logic is by \"upgrading\" the concept of a bit to a probability bit (p-bit). In this context, a convenient way to represent p-bits is by the use of a [probability vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_vector), where an element of the vector represents the probability of measuring the binary value given by the vector index of that element."

    "This vector implies that the probability of finding state $00$ is $1/6$. This checks out because we initialized $\\vec{p}_0$ to be $1$ with probability $1/3$, so after applying the $\\text{X}$ gate, the output state should be $0$ with probability of $1/3$. In the case of $\\vec{p}_1$, we always get $0$ with probability $1/2$ independent of the input, so the probability of finding $00$ is $1/3 \\times 1/2 = 1/6$.\n",

    "It is also possible to construct multi p-bit matrices that cannot be expressed as the Kronecker product of individual p-bit matrices. These matrices are known as [stochastic matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix) and represent the transition from one possible state of a system to another, where the future state of a single p-bit depends on the previous state of all other p-bits in the system. For instance, the matrix below represents a system where the state of p-bit $\\vec{p}_0$ will remain unchanged if $\\vec{p}_1$ is in state $0$, but will randomize $\\vec{p}_0$ if $\\vec{p}_1$ is in state $1$. It turns out, we cannot decompose this matrix into a Kronecker product of separate single p-bit matrices because the results of the state of a p-bit depend on the state of the other.\n",
