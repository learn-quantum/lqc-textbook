# Learn Quantum Computing using Python
<hr></hr>

Welcome!

This online textbook is meant to serve as a reference guide to the field of quantum computing using an applied approach. 

Instead of solely focusing on the theory and equations needed to get acquainted with the field, this website is designed to help you understand the necessary concepts to learn quantum computation, communication, and information by using code written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). In particular, this guide uses [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), which is currently considered to be the most popular Python package for the implementation, simulation, and execution of quantum programs. However, other packages might be supported in the future.
